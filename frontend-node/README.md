This is a web application demonstrates How to encrypt a message with a Public-Key using the [Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) of the browser.


Reminder:

The Public-Key is generated by a **C# Backend Web API**, any frontend application can use it to encrypt the message and only the **C# Backend Web API** could decrypt it with the Private-Key.
